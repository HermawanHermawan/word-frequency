PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this Project, we will scrape a novel from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. Then we will extract words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. Finally, we will dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk).

The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text. To complete this Project, we will demonstrate how to import web data into Python and how to work with natural language text.
